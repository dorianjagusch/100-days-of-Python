</h1>

The "[100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)" is an extensive programming course designed to help students master the Python programming language through a series of 100 unique projects spread over 100 days.

The course content is divided into several areas:

  - Python Basics: The course starts with the basics of Python programming, helping beginners get comfortable with the syntax and basic concepts.

  - Web Scraping and APIs: The course covers practical uses of Python such as web scraping and working with APIs. It makes use of libraries like Selenium and Beautiful Soup.

  - Web Development with Flask: We learn how to build web applications using the Flask framework. There are also units about HTML, CSS, and SQLight.

  - Data Science and Machine Learning: The course includes modules on data science and machine learning. We learn how to use libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit Learn, Plotly, and Matplotlib for data analysis and machine learning.

  - Game Development: The course covers game development with Python by having us build simple games like Blackjack, Pong, and Snake.

  - Desktop Application Development:  Developing desktop applications using Python 3.

By the end of the course, I should be able to build fully-fledged websites and web apps with Python, and have a portfolio of 100 Python projects.
